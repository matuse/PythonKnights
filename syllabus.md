# Python Knights Study Group

The python knights study group will meet one night a week for 12 weeks on Monday's at 7PM

I, Matt James, will lead the group discussion and attempt to keep things on-topic and on-time.  
The material features ~10 page chapters to keep the content in bite sized chunks.  
However, as you'll notice below, I've lumped some weeks together in an attempt to keep this class   
from going too many weeks. With that said, I'm open to re-shuffle if as a group we determine it's necessary.

## Location
We'll be using SFS's Big Blue Button instance to host this class.  
If BBB is down / malfunctioning, we'll use Google Hangouts as our fallback.   
Please use your name and "expert" for the password if you would like to share any content,   
otherwise simply use "novice" as the password

## Schedule
We'll meet weekly, 7 - 9PM ish, basically, however long it takes us to cover the material and not pass out 

Week 1 -    3/14    - Ch 1  
Week 2 -    3/21    - Ch 2 and 3  
Week 3 -    3/28    - Ch 4 and 5  
Week 4 -    4/4     - Ch 6  
Week 5 -    4/11    - Ch 7  
Week 6 -    4/18    - Ch 8  
Week 7 -    4/25    - Ch 9, 10 and 11  
Week 8 -    5/2     - Ch 12 and 13

## Recommended pre-requisites
* At least some exposure to coding / scripting. This will be an beginner / introductory course but any cary over   
knowledge from other languages will be useful.

* Have a computer with Python 2 already installed. We can go over this the first week but if you have it already done,   
all the more time to work through the material.

* I use and recommend PyCharm Community Edition editor by JetBrains. I will be using it in class demonstrations.
